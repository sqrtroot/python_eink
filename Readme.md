# Python/C++ E-Ink Display Driver

This project provides C++ and Python libraries for driving e-ink displays on Linux and Windows. This library allows for quick and easy programming of e-ink displays with either Python or C++.

## Features

- Uses modern C++ for safe and full control over the e-ink screens
- Python bindings for easier integration with Python projects.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. fmt library: `libfmt` is a modern formatting library.
2. OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
3. pybind11: A lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa.

Please refer to their respective official documentation for installation guidelines.

## Installation

### Installing the Python Bindings

The Python bindings can be installed with the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sqrtroot/python_eink.git
```

## Usage

Refer to the example files in the `examples/` directory to get started using the libraries.
